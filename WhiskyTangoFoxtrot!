What is the purpose (or even the mission) of the Programming Historian Project?
The purpose of the PHP, is to provide help and information between peer posted and user friendly tutorials/reviews on digital and technical tools. How to use them in research, teaching and how to facilitate.

Who is the audience for the project?
Peer friendly and people learning how to or share their knowledge on how to instruct with or use new digital tools and technology.

Would you consider the work of The Project Historian the work of technical writing/communication? Why? Or Why not? I would consider The Projectg Historian the work of technical writing due to the fact that it provides tutorials and how-to's information on how to go about either learning new digital/technology tools; and it also provides you as the individual, to load up a tutorial yourself to share with peers on the information you may know on how-to work with some of this technology.
